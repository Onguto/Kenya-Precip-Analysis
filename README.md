#🌍 Kenya’s 2024 Floods: What the Data Reveals & Why It Matters

2024 has been a year of extreme weather for Kenya. Unprecedented rainfall led to devastating floods, displacing thousands, disrupting infrastructure, and posing serious public health risks. As climate variability intensifies, data-driven insights are crucial for preparedness and response.

Using CHIRPS daily precipitation data in Google Earth Engine (GEE), I analyzed Kenya’s rainfall patterns for 2024 to uncover key trends and their implications for climate resilience and public health.

🔹 Mapping Rainfall Extremes A spatial analysis of mean precipitation shows the areas hardest hit by heavy rains. Regions such as western Kenya and parts of Nairobi experienced extreme rainfall, exacerbating urban flooding and increasing risks of waterborne diseases.

🔹 Tracking Monthly Variability A time-series analysis reveals sharp fluctuations in rainfall, with early 2024 seeing record-breaking precipitation. These intense wet spells contributed to flash floods, while drier months exposed vulnerabilities in water security, particularly for agriculture-dependent communities.

🔹 Why This Matters for Climate & Health Flooding isn’t just a climate issue—it’s a public health crisis. Stagnant water creates breeding grounds for malaria and cholera, while disrupted sanitation systems heighten risks of waterborne outbreaks. Understanding precipitation patterns allows for better early warning systems, improved health interventions, and adaptive water management strategies.

🔎 What’s Next?
As extreme weather events become more frequent, data-driven decision-making is no longer optional—it’s essential. Governments, humanitarians, and researchers must integrate real-time climate intelligence into disaster preparedness and public health planning.

Let’s leverage climate data for resilience. What strategies do you think can help Kenya adapt better?
